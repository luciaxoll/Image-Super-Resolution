The model is developed based on Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ) datset. A random sample of the dataset is chosen and zip into a file to start.

FFHQ2.zip: within the zip file is a folder "FFHQ2", within the "FFHQ2" folder is the folder "02000".
Folder "FFHQ2": sample from FFHQ dataset.
Folder "02000": contains images from 02000-02500 in the FFHQ dataset. 

Images are downloaded from:
